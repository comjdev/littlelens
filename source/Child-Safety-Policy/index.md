## Our Commitment to Child Safety

At Little Lens, we are committed to promoting the safety, wellbeing, and rights of all children. We take our legal and ethical responsibilities seriously to ensure every child we photograph is safe, respected, and protected from harm.
We operate in accordance with the Child Wellbeing and Safety Act 2005 (VIC) and are fully compliant with the Victorian Child Safe Standards, particularly when working with early childhood education and care services.

### Our Child Safe Principles

We uphold the following key principles in all our work:

- **Child-Centred Approach:** We prioritise the best interests of the child in every interaction and decision.
- **Zero Tolerance for Abuse** We do not tolerate any form of child abuse or harm, including physical, emotional, sexual abuse or neglect.
- **Empowerment and Respect** We respect each child‚Äôs identity, abilities, culture, and voice. We encourage children to participate in a way that is comfortable for them.
- **Cultural Safety and Inclusion** We are committed to cultural safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and children with a disability.

### Our Practices

- **Consent and Permissions:** We always obtain written consent from parents or legal guardians prior to photographing any child. No images are used for marketing, portfolios, or social media without explicit, documented permission.
- **Supervision:** Children are never left unsupervised with a photographer. An educator or authorised staff member must be present at all times during photo sessions.
- **Professional Conduct:** All photographers undergo Working with Children Checks (WWCC) and understand their obligations as child-safe professionals. We adhere to a strict code of conduct when engaging with children and families.
- **Data Privacy and Image Security:** All images are stored securely and handled in compliance with Australian privacy laws. Access to images is restricted and not shared with third parties without prior consent.

## Reporting Concerns

We take all concerns about child safety seriously. If you witness or suspect any inappropriate conduct, please report it immediately. We are committed to responding to and reporting concerns in accordance with our legal obligations.
