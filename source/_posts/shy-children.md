## What if my child does not want to be photographed / is very shy?

It's perfectly normal for some children to feel a bit hesitant or shy when it's time for their photo. As a childcare photographer, I've seen it all – from wide-eyed wonder to cautious curiosity. My approach is always gentle and patient, prioritising a relaxed and playful atmosphere above all else. I understand that forcing a smile or rushing a child can lead to stiff, unnatural photos, and that's the opposite of what I want to achieve.

Instead, I believe in giving each child the space and time they need to warm up to the camera. Sometimes, that means starting with a simple chat, a silly face, or even just observing them playing. My goal is to build a connection, to show them that having their photo taken can be a fun and enjoyable experience. I'll bring along some playful props or engage them in simple activities to help them feel at ease.

While those big, beaming smiles are always a delight to capture, I also cherish the quiet moments, the thoughtful expressions, and the unique quirks that make each child special. My focus is on capturing their genuine personality, whether they're giggling, exploring, or simply being themselves.

### What parents can do

I know that as parents, you want to treasure these precious years, and that's why I strive to create images that reflect the true essence of your child. I'll work closely with the childcare staff to understand your child's personality and interests, and I'll adapt my approach accordingly.

The key is patience and understanding. I'll never push a child beyond their comfort zone. My aim is to create a positive and memorable experience for everyone, ensuring that your child's photos capture their unique spark and personality, no matter how shy they might be. Remember, even the quietest moments can be the most beautiful.
