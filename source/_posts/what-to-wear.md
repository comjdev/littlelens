## Dress for fun! What to wear for childcare and kinder photos.

One of the most common questions I get from parents is, 'What should my child wear for their childcare or kinder photos?' And it's a great question!

Let's start by putting your mind at ease. Unlike family photos where coordinating outfits can be part of the fun, childcare and kinder photos are all about capturing your child's unique personality and spirit right now. This is a snapshot of them in their happy place, surrounded by their friends and teachers.

### Comfort is key for happy photos

So, here's my biggest piece of advice: let them be themselves! If your little one has a favourite colour that makes them light up, let them wear it proudly. We want these photos to be a cherished keepsake of this special time in their lives, a reminder of their playful days at childcare.

The most important thing to keep in mind is comfort. Happy kids make for happy photos! Think soft, comfortable clothes that allow them to move freely and play without any distractions. Scratchy fabrics or restrictive outfits might make them feel uneasy, and we want them to feel relaxed and confident in front of the camera. Clean, comfortable clothes are always a winning choice.

### Let their personality shine through

Remember, the magic of these photos lies in the genuine expressions and the joy on your child's face, not in the fanciest outfit. Let their personality shine through! Why not involve them in the process? Lay out a few options and let them choose what they want to wear. Giving them a sense of ownership often makes them feel proud and excited about what they’re going to wear.
When you register your child online, you'll find a space to add any special requests. This is the perfect place to let me know if you'd like their winter jacket removed, if they should wear a specific beanie, or if you have any preferences regarding jumpers or cardigans.
Just a friendly reminder: due to time constraints, we won't be able to accommodate outfit changes during the photo session. Your child will be photographed in the clothes they arrive in.

## Some final notes for photo day

When it comes to hair, I understand that little ones are often on the move! While I'll certainly do my best to tidy up any stray strands that are clearly obstructing their eyes – ensuring those beautiful faces are visible – please remember that hair can shift and move as they play and interact. I aim for natural, candid shots, and sometimes a little bit of playful disarray adds to the charm! So, while I'll make sure they look their best, I also want to capture the real, joyful moments of their day, even if that means a few hair strands out of place.

Ultimately, these photos are about capturing the essence of your child's time at childcare or kinder. Let them wear what makes them happy and comfortable, and together, we'll create beautiful memories that you'll treasure for years to come!
