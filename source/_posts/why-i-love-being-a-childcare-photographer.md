## Why I love my job as a kindy / childcare photographer

Over the years, my career path has naturally intertwined my two passions: capturing moments through photography and working in various roles with children. Both have always been what I enjoy, which is why becoming a childcare and kindy photographer has been such a natural thing for me to do. It’s been a beautiful way to combine these two professions that I absolutely adore.

With over 10 years of experience photographing children and their families, I have met a lot of little, and big, personalities along the way. This is probably my favourite part of the job. I love chatting to each child during their photo session and hearing what they have to say. Often it’s the most random bits of information - a profound insight about the migratory patterns of butterflies, a detailed critique of their morning snack, or an enthusiastic demonstration of their latest dance move.
These glimpses into their personalities not only make my day but are also incredibly valuable in capturing their true spirit on camera. When a child feels seen, heard, and acknowledged, their genuine personality naturally shines through, resulting in photographs that are vibrant, authentic, and full of life.

## Every childcare centre is unique

Every kindy and childcare centre I visit has its own special atmosphere, a space where first discoveries are made daily, friendships are just beginning to bloom, and little personalities shine through. To step into that environment, even for a fleeting moment, and to be entrusted with the task of documenting a part of that precious journey is something I don't take lightly. It's about so much more than simply clicking a button; it's about capturing the fleeting essence of childhood in all its authentic wonder.

## A selection of photos for you to choose from

I’m also a Mum to 2 primary school aged kids and it feels like just yesterday that I was looking at their own childcare photos. I remember loving them and being so glad that even though I have so many photos of my kids, that I had some in their childcare setting. The only thing I wished for, was that there was more. This is why I aim to get a selection of photos of each child for their family to choose from.

Being a kindy and childcare photographer isn't just a profession for me; it's a joyful calling that allows me to combine my photography skills with my genuine love for children and storytelling. It's about capturing the magic within their familiar childcare centre and creating lasting memories for the families I have the privilege to work with. And for that, I am truly grateful.
