## Hi, I’m Gill

I am a passionate childcare and kindy photographer based in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I believe every family deserves, beautiful high-quality photos that capture the magic of childhood. With over 10 years of experience photographing children, and as a Mum myself, I understand the importance of creating a fun and relaxed environment.

My approach is warm, patient and child-led, with play being at the heart of my photography. I believe it’s the key to capturing authentic moments where kids are so busy having fun that they forget they’re having their photo taken. By creating a relaxed and fun atmosphere, I help children feel comfortable and enjoy the experience, resulting in truly natural photos.

As well as working as a photographer for many years, I’ve also worked in primary schools. This experience has given me invaluable insight into the many different personalities of children and how to connect with them on their level. It's more than just taking photos; it's about building trust and creating a fun, comfortable environment. This is so important when wanting them to feel relaxed for their photos, allowing their true smiles and personalities to shine through. I understand that every child is unique, and I pride myself on my ability to adapt and make each session a positive experience.

## Childcare centres and kindergartens

Childcare centres and kindergartens provide such a vibrant and dynamic backdrop for photography. I love to make the most of the playful environments, capturing children as they explore, learn and have fun. Whether it’s a quiet moment with a favourite toy or the boundless energy of outdoor play. I aim to create images that tell the story of your centre’s unique atmosphere.

Photography isn't just my job, it's my passion. When I'm not capturing the adorable moments at childcare centres, you'll often find me snapping photos for fun – yes, I truly love it that much! When I'm not at a childcare centre / kindergarten you will find me spending time with my husband, our 2 kids and our 2 dogs. They keep me on my toes and remind me of the beauty in everyday moments. I bring that same joy and love for capturing life's little treasures into every session.
