# Information for Childcare centres

I understand that organising photography for your kinder / childcare centre can bring up a few questions, so I’ve put together some answers to help you and your families feel completely at ease. First off, families only invest in the photos they truly love, paying after they have viewed their child’s images. And don’t worry about handling orders - I take care of everything and prints will be delivered directly to your centre.
To capture those natural smiles, I prefer outdoor sessions, using the children’s familiar play spaces and beautiful natural light.

You’ll find online galleries ready within 7-10 business days after my last day at your centre, with families receiving clear notifications and a 10-day window for free delivery to your centre. Digital files are available all year and I even provide bright marketing materials to help promote the photo day.

Staff and class photos are offered, with clear guidelines for scheduling. For those unavoidable absences, I arrange make-up sessions on other days I’m booked at your centre, with sibling photos always welcome. And to ensure every family has a smooth experience, I provide comprehensive support for any ordering questions. Now, let’s dive into a few more details about how we can make this process seamless and enjoyable for everyone.

## Frequently Asked Questions for Childcare Centres

### Do families pay upfront?

Families will only invest in photos they truly love. They simply register their child for their session prior to photo day, and payment is due after they've viewed their images and placed an order.

### Do we need to organise the photo orders?

No need to worry about photo orders at all! I take care of everything. Families will receive easy-to-follow information for ordering, and I’ll deliver the prints right to the centre for you. My goal is to create a stress-free experience for everyone involved.

### Where do you take the photos at our centre?

To capture the most natural and happy moments, I prefer to photograph the children outdoors. I maximise natural light and the children's comfort by photographing outdoors in their familiar play spaces. This ensures happy, genuine photos that are unique to your centre.

### What is the turnaround time?

**Gallery Availability:**

Online photo galleries will be ready 7-10 business days after the last photo day.

**Family Notification:**

Families will receive an email and SMS when their child's gallery is online.
Each family will get a private passcode to access their child's photos.
Families will be given a deadline for ordering printed photos.

**Ordering Period:**

Families have 10 days to order printed photo packages for free delivery to the centre.
Digital files can be ordered online until the end of the year.
Printed orders placed after the 10 day deadline will incur a $15 postage fee.

**Photo Delivery:**

Printed photos will be delivered to the centre 2-3 weeks after the print order deadline.

### Do you provide marketing materials such as flyers or posters for the photo days?

Yes, I'll provide bright, eye-catching posters for your centre and helpful flyers for each child a month before our session, so parents can easily pre-register online.

### Do you have a WWCC?

Yes, I do and am happy to provide a copy upon request.

### Do you have insurance?

Yes, I have public liability insurance and am happy to provide proof upon request.

### Do you take staff photos?

Yes. I take staff photos at the end of the morning when the list is completed for the day. It is best done on 1 day only at the one time to achieve consistent light for each staff photo. Please communicate this set day in advance to your staff members so they are aware and can apply makeup/style their hair etc if they wish.

### Do you take class photos?

Yes, for childcare centres, a composite class photo is prepared for each class. It is the best forward facing individual photo that is preselected by myself to be on the class composite.

For kinders, a traditional style class photo is taken with all the children in that class sitting together. Class photos are taken on a designated day, with the children present in class at the scheduled time.

### What if a child is sick / absent on photo day?

If a child is unwell or absent on their scheduled photo day, don't worry! We can arrange a convenient make-up session for them on another day I'm at the centre

### Do you take sibling photos?

Yes, I do offer sibling photos. I usually take them on the youngest child's photo day, and just ask that both children are registered. We make sure this is clear during the registration process.

### Do you offer support for families when ordering their photos?

Absolutely! Families can call during business hours or email me anytime for help with questions, rescheduling, or orders. I also welcome the centre to pass on questions for direct family support.
