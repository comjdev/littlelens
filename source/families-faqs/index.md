# Information for families

I understand that photo day can bring up a few questions, so I've gathered some helpful information to make the process as smooth as possible First, please register your child online [HERE] to secure their spot and view my package options, which start at just $30. If your little one is unwell, we can reschedule for another day where I’m booked in at your centre.

I’m pro at working with shy children, creating a relaxed and playful atmosphere. Sibling photos are a special treat, so register them for the same day! For clothing, think comfort, and remember there's no time for outfit changes. If you need help with ordering or downloads, don't hesitate to reach out.

Printed photos will arrive within 2-3 weeks with free centre delivery. Digital downloads are sent promptly, and I'll remind you about the 10-day print ordering window. Even if you miss the deadline, digital downloads are always an option!
To help you prepare for your child's photo day and understand the process, here are some frequently asked questions.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do families register for photos?

Registering your child for their photos is quick and easy! You'll receive a flyer with all the details before photo day, and your centre will also display posters as reminders. It's essential to register your child as individual photos won't be taken without registration. This registration process also provides me with the necessary permission to photograph your child. It only takes a few minutes, so please make sure to register!

### What if my child is shy or does not want to be photographed?

I understand that some children can be a little shy or hesitant about having their photo taken. My approach is relaxed and playful, and I give each child time to warm up to the camera. While big smiles are always lovely, my goal is to capture each child's unique personality, whether they're smiling or simply enjoying their time at childcare. I focus on creating a fun and comfortable environment so I can capture natural and genuine moments.

### What if it rains on photo day?

Melbourne weather can be unpredictable, but don't worry about rain on photo day! My priority is the safety and comfort of the children and staff. I'll work closely with the centre to find the best solution. If possible, we'll try to capture outdoor photos during any breaks in the weather. However, if the weather is unsafe, we'll move the fun indoors and take photos of the children enjoying their day there.

### What happens if my child is absent on photo day?

I understand that sickness and unforeseeable circumstances take place and this may mean your child cannot attend the centre on the day you have registered them for photos. As I am generally at each centre for more than 1 day, there may be the opportunity to bring your child in on another day and I can photograph them then. Please contact me to reschedule your child’s photos for another day during my time at your centre.

### What do I need to do for photos to be taken of my child?

To have your child's individual photo taken, simply complete the online registration form [HERE] before photo day. This registration gives me permission to photograph your child.

### What are the prices of photo packages/ Prints?

Pricing is to suit all budgets starting from $30 for a basic package with a selection of 1 photo in various sizes, then the option of bigger packages with more images selected up to full gallery options. A range of prints and digital packages are available. Package pricing is available to view when registering your child online.

### Do you take sibling photos?

Yes, capturing the unique relationship between siblings is something I really enjoy. I will ensure they have photos together during the photo morning, provided they are both/all registered for photos.  
A gallery of images is provided for each child separately with the photos of the siblings together placed into the youngest child's photo gallery. Please select the SAME photo day for each of your siblings so we can photograph them together.

### What should my child wear for their photo day?

Whatever makes them happy! Kids are usually happiest wearing comfortable clothes that they wear regularly, rather than fancier clothes that they may find uncomfortable.  
Please keep in mind, we do not have time for outfit changes during the photos and children will only be photographed in one set of clothes.

### I am having trouble ordering my photos. What do I do?

Not a problem. Families can call during business hours or email me anytime for help with questions, rescheduling, or orders. I also welcome the centre to pass on questions for direct family support.

### When do I receive my printed photos?

Printed photo orders placed by the deadline will arrive at the centre within 2-3 weeks of the print closing date.

### Delivery

Easy delivery! All orders placed within the timeframe will be delivered to your centre at no cost.

### I Didn't Receive My Downloads

Your digital photos will be sent to your email right after payment. If you don't see your download link arrive within a few minutes, please take a peek in your spam or junk folder. If you're using a work email, or Hotmail/Outlook, it's possible your email system may have filtered it out. If you still can't find it, please reach out to me.

### I Forgot to Order

If print orders have closed, don't worry! You can still purchase digital downloads of your child's adorable photos.

### How long do I have to order prints?

You'll get reminders about the 10-day print ordering period via email, text, and your gallery. Free delivery to the centre is included for all orders placed within that time.
