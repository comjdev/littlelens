## My process

### Photos will be taken outdoors if possible

Photos will ideally be taken in your outdoor play area, using lots of natural light and shady areas. If all that is available is indoor light - I will set up near windows to still be able to use natural light. I never use flash photography, as it can be disruptive for children.

### Start time

**Start time:** I recommend starting at 8:30am. I will arrive shortly after 8am to ensure we are ready to go.

**Finish time:** I find that it is best to photograph during the morning only and not past midday.

### My scheduled days at your centre

- 2 days for centres of 60 children or less,
- 2 or 3 days for centres of 60-80 children,
- 3 or 4 days for 80 - approx 110 children,
- Bigger centres - longer depending on size.

I aim to photograph about 20-30 children per day only - this ensures I have suitable time to capture a range of beautiful photos for each registered child.

### The registration process

To capture beautiful photos of each child, families are kindly asked to register for a photography session. Registration provides the necessary permission for me to photograph each child.

Information on how to register will be available through flyers sent home and posters displayed at your centre.

### Provision of one staff member to assist

Having a staff member assist with photos on photo day makes the whole process smoother and faster for everyone. It's also a great way to help the children feel more comfortable, as they're familiar with the staff member.

### Rainy weather

Melbourne weather can be unpredictable, but don’t worry about rain on photo day. Usually we can find somewhere on the verandah outdoors to capture lovely photos. My priority is the safety and comfort of the children and staff and I’ll work closely with you to find the best solution. If possible, we’ll wait for gaps in the rain to take outdoor photos. However, if the weather is unsafe, we’ll move the fun indoors and take photos of the children enjoying their familiar indoor space.

## Pricing and packaging

Pricing is to suit all budgets starting from $30 for a basic package with a selection of 1 photo in various sizes, then the option of bigger packages with more images selected up to full gallery options.

A range of prints and digital packages are available.

Package pricing is available for families to view when registering their child online.

### Absent children

If a child is absent on their scheduled photo day, I’ll happily reschedule their session for another day I’m at the centre.

### Shy children

I do my very best to encourage children to ‘play’ for photos, by interacting with bubbles, songs and distraction as best as I can. Sometimes a staff member can help them feel comfortable.

While I always strive to capture beaming smiles, I understand that every child is unique, and some may be more reserved. In these instances, especially with babies and toddlers, I focus on capturing candid moments of them engaged in their activities.

I certainly will keep trying on the morning to capture what I can to make a lovely gallery for the family to view.

## Photos

### Class photo

A composite class photo is prepared for each class. It is the best forward facing individual photo that is preselected by myself to be on the class composite.

### Traditional class photo (kindergarden only)

Class photos are taken on one designated day, with the children present in class at the scheduled time.

I make every effort to capture photos of all children looking at the camera. Smiles are encouraged, but ultimately this depends on the child's comfort level on the day.

All children present will be included in the class photo.

### Sibling photos

Sibling photos are taken on the **youngest child**'s photo day. Both children must be registered for photos. Families are made aware of this during the registration process.

#### Sibling photos with children not at the centre

There is the opportunity for this to occur by special arrangement only. This can be discussed and added to your centre booking if requested.

### Staff photos

I take staff photos at the end of the morning when the list is completed for the day. It is best done on 1 day only at the one time to achieve consistent light for each staff photo.

Please communicate this set day in advance to your staff members so they are aware and can apply makeup/style their hair etc if they wish.
