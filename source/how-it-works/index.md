## How my childcare and kindergarten photography works

Booking your centre for a fun and stress-free photo experience is easy! Simply get in touch as early as possible to secure your preferred dates. We'll then work together to finalise all the necessary details based on your centre's specific requirements.

Approximately six weeks before your scheduled dates, I'll provide you with posters and flyers with booking in info. This will guide parents through a simple online registration process where they can also select their child's preferred photo day. Importantly, there are absolutely no upfront payments required, just a straightforward registration for each child.

Once the photo day is complete, parents will receive individual notifications when their child's gallery is ready for viewing, allowing them to conveniently make their purchases online, with all orders delivered directly to your centre. My primary aim throughout this entire process is to make everything as easy as possible for all staff members and families.

## Making photo day a playful adventure

At the heart of my childcare photography approach is the simple magic of play! To make the experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible for everyone.

With over ten years of experience photographing children and their families, I've had the pleasure of working with countless unique personalities.

My approach prioritises creating a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, ideally capturing all the fun outdoors in your childcare or kindergarten's familiar play areas. Whether it's through gentle encouragement, playful interactions, or simply allowing kids to be themselves, I believe that when children feel at ease, their natural joy and the happiest smiles truly shine through in their photographs.

## What to Expect on Childcare Photo Day

Photo day at your childcare centre is designed to be a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone. I typically arrive around 8:15 am, allowing 15 minutes to ensure everything is ready to go by our 8:30 am start. I aim to complete all children's photography before lunchtime, as this is generally when little ones begin to get tired.

The flow of the day usually begins with the youngest children who are registered for photos. I'll photograph them within their familiar age-appropriate play areas, and then gradually work our way through the older age groups. Flexibility is a key part of my approach, and I'm always prepared to adapt to the children's needs and the natural rhythm of the day. Staff photos will be taken after all the individual and any sibling children's photos are complete.

Booking me as your childcare photographer brings a wealth of benefits, starting with the reassurance of over ten years of experience specifically photographing children. You can also enjoy a completely stress-free process, as I take care of all the details, and there are no upfront payments required.

My approach is always fun and relaxed, ensuring a positive experience for every child. To ensure no one misses out due to attendance schedules, I'm happy to be on-site for the entire week. Families will also appreciate the fast turnaround times, with photos ready to view just 7-10 working days after my last day at your centre, and a range of affordable packages starting from only $30 to suit all budgets.
