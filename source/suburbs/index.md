At Little Lens, I specialise in relaxed, high-quality childcare photography for early learning centres across Melbourne’s eastern and southern suburbs. Whether you're located in Ferntree Gully, Glen Waverley, Boronia, Knox, or anywhere in between, I bring a calm, fun energy that helps little ones feel comfortable and natural in front of the camera.

From candid playground moments to class portraits and sibling shots, my sessions are designed to capture genuine smiles and real connections — while making picture day stress-free for educators and centre managers.

Below is a list of the suburbs I currently service. Click on your suburb to learn more about the photography experience I offer in your area:
