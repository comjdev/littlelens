						How do families register for photos?
					</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-500">
						Registering your child for their photos is quick and easy! You'll
						receive a flyer with all the details before photo day, and your
						centre will also display posters as reminders. It's essential to
						register your child as individual photos won't be taken without
						registration. This registration process also provides me with the
						necessary permission to photograph your child. It only takes a few
						minutes, so please make sure to register!

						What if my child is shy or does not want to be photographed?
					</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-500">
						I understand that some children can be a little shy or hesitant
						about having their photo taken. My approach is relaxed and playful,
						and I give each child time to warm up to the camera. While big
						smiles are always lovely, my goal is to capture each child's unique
						personality, whether they're smiling or simply enjoying their time
						at childcare. I focus on creating a fun and comfortable environment
						so I can capture natural and genuine moments.

						What if it rains on photo day?
					</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-500">
						Melbourne weather can be unpredictable, but don't worry about rain
						on photo day! My priority is the safety and comfort of the children
						and staff. I'll work closely with the centre to find the best
						solution. If possible, we'll try to capture outdoor photos during
						any breaks in the weather. However, if the weather is unsafe, we'll
						move the fun indoors and take photos of the children enjoying their
						day there.

						What happens if my child is absent on photo day?
					</h3>
					<p class="text-gray-500">
						I understand that sickness and unforeseeable circumstances take
						place and this may mean your child cannot attend the centre on the
						day you have registered them for photos. As I am generally at each
						centre for more than 1 day, there may be the opportunity to bring
						your child in on another day and I can photograph them then. Please
						contact me to reschedule your childâ€™s photos for another day during
						my time at your centre.
